						<h1 id="project">Overview</h1>
						<p>Our goal was to increase the amount of meaningful information and functionalities that encourages
							users to book their trips through our wayfare travel app. We tested this prototype
							with 10 users. We aimed to make travel plans easier and
							faster without going to browser many apps.</p>

			<h2>Understanding the User</h2>
			<p>The most meaningful way for us to learn about travel apps
			   was to interview both present and past users.
			</p>
			<img id="process" src="images/portfolio03.jpg" alt="mobile">
			<ul>
				<li>Understand the customer behavior.</li>
				<li>Identify the competition and difference in the industry.</li>
				<li>Determine the target and audience.</li>
				<li>Design, iterate and test solutions.</li>
				<li>Deliver the most impactful solution within the timeframe.</li>
			</ul>

				<h2>Business Research</h2>
				<p>To see how Wayfare compared to competitors, we analyzed multiple
				   travel apps.</p>
				<p><strong>Wayfare Advantages</strong>: Extensive travel destinations
					and more payment options than its competitors Travel checklist.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Wayfare Disadvantages</strong>: New to the market so it’s
					unknown - Low traffic and “Call to Action” buttons not big enough.
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Designing Our Solution</h2>
			<p>Wireframes created to fit user insights</p>
			<p><strong>Lo-Fi Wireframe</strong>: We each came up with ideas to make user
				experience smooth and easy. We took the results of the data found in user
				research and compared them to our insights. We took our ideas and converted
				them into a paper prototype.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Mid-Fi Prototype</strong>: We tested our prototype on family and
				friends. Our Mid-Fi interactive prototype was used for usability tests.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Hi-Fi Prototype</strong>: Our Hi-Fi interactive prototype was tested on
				users. We updated the app according to the results.

		<h2>Usability Testing & User Interview</h2>
		<p> had users complete some tests in the paper prototype. A few finding in the
		research caused us to make some changes. Users were skeptical because there
		weren’t many reviews amd the buttons were not very clear.
