          <h3>How did I get here?</h3>
          <p>
            I can’t pinpoint the exact moment I decided to be a developer. It
            was a gradual slide from curiosity to near obsession. I’ve never
            been crazy about video games, social networking, or coffee-making
            robots. I like record players, writing letters, and making things
            with my hands. I don’t always love technology, but I do love using
            it to make people happy, and turning a blank screen into something
            helpful, meaningful, beautiful, and fun.
          </p>

          <h3>Hello world</h3>
          <p>
            When I started working as a product manager, I had to know enough
            about technology to efficiently communicate requirements to
            developers as well as technical constraints and options to the
            business. Once I learned a little bit about how our systems and
            website worked, I just wanted more. I wanted to understand the code,
            and then I wanted to write it. Lucky for me, I worked with some
            patient developers, architects, systems analysts, and technology
            leaders that helped me get from “what’s a title tag?” to writing my
            own SQL queries to diving in to become a professional developer.
          </p>

          <h3>Looking forward</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to becoming a highly skilled developer, I want to take
            care of the people in front of and behind the screen. Usability,
            design, achieving business goals, and being a good person are
            important to me. I’m looking forward to collaborating with UX,
            visual design, and product owners to build good things. I want to be
            the person who is great at what they do, and great to work with,
            too.
